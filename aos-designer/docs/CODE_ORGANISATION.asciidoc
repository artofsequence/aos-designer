= AOS Designer: Code Organisation

**_WARNING: This document is a work in progress and will evolve a lot until it becomes definitely useful for the community to use. Also please discuss it on the developers mailing list if necessary._**

The purpose of this document is to be a reference for the community to understand the code organisation, architecture and technical choices taken for AOS Designer, the digital sequence edition tool.

These technical design decisions are all taken in the perspective of our objectives for AOSD that are listed in [this document](AOS-Designer-Vision).
